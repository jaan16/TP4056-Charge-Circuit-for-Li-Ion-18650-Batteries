# TP4056-Charge-Circuit-for-Li-Ion-18650-Batteries


## Purpose:

This schematic demonstrates a charging circuit for Li-ion 18650 batteries using the TP4056 IC. The TP4056 is a highly integrated battery charging management IC designed for Li-ion batteries. This circuit provides a safe and efficient charging solution for these types of batteries.

## Components:

- TP4056 IC: This IC handles the battery charging process, including constant current and constant voltage charging modes. It also provides features like overcharge, over-discharge, and overcurrent protection.
- Capacitors: These components filter the input and output voltages, as well as provide stability to the circuit.
- Resistors: These components set the charging current and voltage levels, as well as provide bias for the IC.
- LEDs: These components indicate the charging status (charging or full).

## Operation:

- Input Voltage: The circuit receives an input voltage at the "VIN+" and "VIN-" terminals. This voltage should be higher than the battery voltage.
- Charging Process: The TP4056 IC monitors the battery voltage and current. It starts charging the battery in constant current mode, gradually increasing the current until the battery voltage reaches the target voltage. Then, it switches to constant voltage mode, maintaining the target voltage until the charging current drops to a low level.
- Charging Status: The LEDs indicate the charging status:
- Green LED: Battery is fully charged.
- Red LED: Battery is charging.

## Applications:

Charging Li-ion 18650 batteries: This circuit is ideal for charging Li-ion 18650 batteries used in various applications, such as power banks, portable devices, and electronic gadgets.
